## Project Overview

This project is a dynamic web application built using React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with animations using Framer Motion. It showcases modern web development techniques and is designed as a pet project to explore the capabilities of these technologies in a unified workflow.

## Features

- **React**: Utilizes functional components and hooks for efficient state management and lifecycle operations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Implements a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development with responsive design.
- **Framer Motion**: Integrates motion features to add interactive animations to the UI components, enhancing user experience.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to deepen my understanding of React's ecosystem alongside Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion. It serves as a practical application to demonstrate the integration of UI design and motion graphics within a React application.
